Most people think that time is like a river,
Flowing swift and sure in one direction.
But I have seen the face of time, and I will tell you - 
They are wrong! Time is like an ocean in a storm.
You may wonder who I am and why I say this.
Come, and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard.
