I am guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.
I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had.
I wish I was the monster you think I am.
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
And I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate.
I demand a trial by combat!
