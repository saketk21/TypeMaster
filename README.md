# TypeMaster
TypeMaster is a Java Application using MVC Architecture which lets users check their Typing Speed.

It uses MVC Architecture and is a basic implementation of the [Longest Common Subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) algorithm for calculating the accuracy of typing.

### Usage
For using TypeMaster on your machine, make sure you have installed the Java Runtime Environment for Java 8 and it is added to your PATH variable, and double-click the TypeMaster.jar file.

For all the CLI fanboys out there, use the following command:
```
java -jar TypeMaster.jar
```
